-- You'll now start implementing a better database model. For this, you'll create tables for the professors and universities entity types. The other tables will be created for you.

-- The syntax for creating simple tables is as follows:

-- Create a table for the universities entity type
CREATE TABLE universities (
    university_shortname text,
    university text,
    university_city text
);





-- Print the contents of this table
SELECT * 
FROM universities
